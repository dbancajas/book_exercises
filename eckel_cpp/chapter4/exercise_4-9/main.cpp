//Exercise 4-9: Create a file containing a functio() that takes an
//int argument and prints it to the console using the printf()
//function in <stdio.h> by saying: printf("%d\n",l) in which L is
//the int you wish to print. Create a separate file containing
//main() and in this file declare f() to take a float argument.
//Call f() from inside main(). Try to compile and link your
//program with the C++ compiler and see what happens. Now compile
//and linke the program using the C compiler, and see what happens
//when it runs. Explain the behaviour.

//Answer: I think this question is out of date. The compiler has probably alreayd adopted??

int main(void){

	f(9);
