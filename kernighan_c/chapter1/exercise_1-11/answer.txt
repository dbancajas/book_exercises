Question 1-11: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely
to uncover bugs if there are any?

I got this from the answer key.

1. Words that have dashes
2. if you have colons separating two words.
3. no input
4. no words
5. one word per line
6. word starting at the beginning of the line
7. word starting after some blanks
